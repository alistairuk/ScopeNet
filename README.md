# ScopeNet

This project was created as part of the Nasa Space Apps Challenges 2015

It provides a simple Python script that enables a user to link a telescope to het ScopeNet network. In wich it can be assigned jobs, these jobs will be requested by people around the world.

By using a simple correlation algorithm combined with image stacking, the script is able to significantly reduce noise in a picture.

During the further develpment of this project more features will be added.

The telescope itself needs to be actuated, the control of the actuators is done by an Arduino. In that way the whole concept is low cost and accessible to everyone who want to help!
